== Description ==

This plugin allows sites to accept user-entered custom donation amounts through Paypal, including recurring donations.  Paypal's buttons have a drawback in that they do not provide a consistent design w.r.t. the ability to send a note. A note is required to allow a donar to give instructions about their donation. e.g. to specify how the total donation should be devided between various funds. This plugin will collect a note specifying donation instructions before going to PayPal. The user then chooses their payment method and whether the donation is recurring or not. The plugin requires that an IPN url is placed into the Paypal configuration for the receiving account. The note is placed in a pass through variable whitch is returned in the IPN. The plugin then builds an email to be sent to the specified receiving account.

The front end view of the plugin is very basic. It contains a block of text which describes the funds to which the donation can be made. There is a basic css file which can be turned on or off throught the admin i/f.

Orginal plugin by Peter VanKoughnett. Too many changes to keep giving him credit as author.

I haven't built any tools to customize the look of the plugin yet.  You can disable the plugin CSS and write your own CSS.
